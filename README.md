A random wallpaper changer in rust that uses Wallhaven API

## Information
This is my first actual rust project so the code will be really bad, and it was thrown together in a quick time... I want to clean this up over time and use it to learn more about the rust language.

## Notes
Currently you have to change the url in the code before will work... Below is a list of things I wish to change with this project.
- Dynamic config so you can easily edit the tags/users you wish to pull from
- Better handling when downloading/saving wallpapers currently they are put in your `$CACHE` which makes it harder to find them
- Cross platform
